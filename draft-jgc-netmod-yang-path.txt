                   draft-jgc-netmod-yang-path-latest

Abstract

   There is a common path format described when interacting with YANG
   modules and the tools surrounding it, named xpath.  The xpath format
   has some shortcomings for YANG module and tool designers and users.

   This draft provides a common path format, the YANG path, to provide a
   self describing method of detailing YANG modelled paths (both in
   schema and in instance data).

1.  Introduction

   A number of path formats currently exist, such as JSON path and
   Xpath.  These path formats serve well for their initial use cases,
   however, when considering a broader YANG generic path format that
   describes both the path and the YANG models that the paths are
   described in are not covered completely.

   In addition, there is a trend towards using JSON for described data
   for YANG instance data and the YANG path format in this document is a
   familiar format.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Format definition

   This section will define the YANG path format using a number of
   examples to cover each situation.

   The YANG path format is designed to be applicable to both YANG schema
   information and YANG instance data.

3.1.  Module:Field format

   The YANG path format is always provided from the root of the YANG
   tree and uses a module:field format where the module is the name of
   the YANG module.  For example:

   /ietf-interfaces:interfaces

   The module is inherited along the path from left to right.  That
   means that if the module does not change (as occurs in augments which
   are discussed later in this document) the module does not need to be
   provided again.  For example:

   /ietf-routing-policy:routing-policy/defined-sets/prefix-sets

3.2.  Augmentations

   When a YANG module is augmented into another the namespace changes.
   This is represented in the YANG path by a change in the module field.

   /ietf-routing:routing/control-plane-protocols/ietf-ospf:ospf/address-
   family

   In this example the module inheritance approach remains, the control-
   plane-protocols container is in the ietf-routing YANG module and the
   address-family leaf is in the ietf-ospf YANG module that has been
   augmented into the ietf-routing module.

3.3.  Deviations

   Deviations do not change the namespace of the YANG nodes and
   therefore the module portion of the YANG path does not change.

3.4.  Import/Include

   Imports and includes do not change the namespace of the YANG nodes
   and therefore the module portion of the YANG path does not change.

3.5.  Lists

   When considering the YANG path for lists it is important to consider
   both the schema and the instance data as these are represented in
   slightly different ways.

3.5.1.  Lists in schema

   YANG lists in schema are represented in the YANG path to the top of
   the list.  For example:

   /ietf-routing-policy:routing-policy/defined-sets/prefix-sets/prefix-
   set

3.5.2.  Lists in instance data

   YANG lists in instance data are represented in the YANG path to the
   top of the list with the list key and the list key's value being
   provided in square brackets.  For example:

   /ietf-routing-policy:routing-policy/defined-sets/prefix-sets/prefix-
   set[name="loopbacks"]

   This means that the YANG path to a leaf under the loopbacks list
   entry would be:

   /ietf-routing-policy:routing-policy/defined-sets/prefix-sets/prefix-
   set[name="loopbacks"]/mode

3.7.  Metadata annotations

3.8.  Wildcards/Regex

5.  IANA Considerations
