                   draft-jgc-netmod-yang-path-latest

Abstract

   There is a common path format described when interacting with YANG
   modules and the tools surrounding it, named xpath.  The xpath format
   has some shortcomings for YANG module and tool designers and users.

   This draft provides a common path format, the YANG path, to provide a
   self describing method of detailing YANG modelled paths (both in
   schema and in instance data).

1.  Introduction

   A number of path formats currently exist, such as JSON path and
   Xpath.  These path formats serve well for their initial use cases,
   however, when considering a broader YANG generic path format that
   describes both the path and the YANG models that the paths are
   described in are not covered completely.

   In addition, there is a trend towards using JSON for described data
   for YANG instance data and the YANG path format in this document is a
   familiar format.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Format definition

   This section will define the YANG path format using a number of
   examples to cover each situation.

   The YANG path format is designed to be applicable to both YANG schema
   information and YANG instance data.

3.1.  Module:Field format

   The YANG path format is always provided from the root of the YANG
   tree and uses a module:field format where the module is the name of
   the YANG module.  For example:

   /ietf-interfaces:interfaces

   The module is inherited along the path from left to right.  That
   means that if the module does not change (as occurs in augments which
   are discussed later in this document) the module does not need to be
   provided again.  For example:

   /ietf-routing-policy:routing-policy/defined-sets/prefix-sets

4.  Security Considerations

   TODO Security

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
